yellow-tubing1:Shock tubing, a yellow plastic tubing resembling thin rope, is used to activate a detonation signal to underwater explosives. Shock tubing was used in a Boston Harbor dredging project that operated from June 2021 to January 2022. 
The yellow plastic tubing resembles thin rope, and it has been found in lengths ranging from 1 millimeter to 90 feet on beaches throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island. (1) ***

yellow-tubing2:The Center for Coastal Studies' Marine Debris and Plastic Program in Provincetown, 
MA, established a link between the dredging project and the shock tubing washing ashore.  
According to the Army Corps press release, the shock tube consists of low-density 
polyethylene. The material is considered safe for humans to touch, but small pieces may 
present health problems for animals if ingested. (2) Dredging can cause physical injury 
or death to marine life through collisions, noise production, and increased cloudiness 
of the water. (3) ***

rope1:While large whale populations are growing in the United States, entanglements pose 
a significant threat to the continued welfare of these species. Vertical buoy 
rope lines connect lobster traps that sit on the ocean floor to a buoy that floats on the surface. 
Whales swimming or feeding near traps can become entangled in this rope. (1) According to estimates from NOAA fisheries and their partners, more than 85 percent of the North Atlantic 
right whale population display indications of entanglement in fishing gear. ***

rope2:Fishing gear can cut into a whale’s body, which can result in serious injuries, infections, or death. While whales can shed the gear, or the rope can be 
removed through disentanglement efforts, entanglement can compromise the animal's strength, impair its ability to 
feed or reproduce, and deplete the animal’s energy required for these vital activities. Scientists believe that chronic 
rope entanglements are one reason why female right whales are having fewer calves.(2) ***

rope3:To safeguard whale populations against entanglement, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and its partners 
are exploring options for modifying lobster traps to be ropeless. A ropeless trap system would remove the risk of marine mammals becoming entangled in vertical buoy lines.(3)
If you encounter an animal that is entangled or in distress, report it immediately. While maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards, stand by the animal until you’ve reported it. 
Stay in your vessel, call your region’s entanglement specialists, note the GPS coordinate of the animal, monitor the situation, and wait for trained personnel to 
free the animal. If you do not have access to a cell phone on your boat, contact the U.S. Coast Guard (VHF channel 16). ***

social1:North Atlantic right whales are social and typically live in pods, or small groups. Pods can range from a few whales to more than a dozen. Cubs usually spend at least 
an entire migration season with their mothers, traveling from Nova Scotia as far as the Gulf of Mexico together. (1) ***

social2:Right whales often socialize at the ocean’s surface; known for their agility, right whales often tail-slap and flipper-wave (2). Right whales use a low-frequency
 to communicate, the whales’ communications. ***


vessel1:Underwater ocean noise pollution has raised concerns about the effects of this on marine 
wildlife who rely on acoustic signaling. Shipping noises, in particular, overlap directly 
with the frequency range of acoustic communication signals used by baleen whales, including 
North Atlantic right whales (1). ***

vessel2:Researchers Rosalind M. Rolland et al. studied stress-related faecal hormone metabolites in 
right whales through measurements of faecel glucocorticoid in response to a decreased 
overall noise level after the decreased vessel travel in the months following 9/11.
The researchers found a decrease in baseline concentrations of fGCs when there was an 
overall noise level decrease caused by fewer vessels traveling. The study also found 
that right whales respond to areas with high anthropogenic noises by amplifying their 
calls and increasing their frequency (2). ***

vessel3:With the North Atlantic right whale population down to seventy reproductive females, 
the National Marine Fisheries Service filed an emergency petition in November, 
2022 to request legislation that sets strict speed limits for vessels with a length 
of 35 feet or greater and that expands the areas where speed limits are required (3). 
The continued efforts for legislation have already seen success. For instance, a 
new bill in Washington state (SB5371) will require boaters to maintain a 1,000 yard 
distance from Southern Resident orcas beginning in 2025. ***
