shock-tubing1,images/shock-tubing1.png,"Shock tubing, a yellow plastic tubing resembling thin rope, is used to activate a detonation signal to underwater explosives. Shock tubing was used in a Boston Harbor dredging project that operated from June 2021 to January 2022. The yellow plastic tubing resembles thin rope, and it has been found in lengths ranging from 1 millimeter to 90 feet on beaches throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island (1).","(1) Eric Williams, ""Finding yellow plastic tubing on Cape Cod beaches?""

shock-tubing2,images/shock-tubing2.png,"The Center for Coastal Studies' Marine Debris and Plastic Program in Provincetown, MA, established a link between the dredging project and the shock tubing washing ashore. The low-density polyethylene material is considered safe for humans to touch, but small pieces may  present health problems for animals if ingested. Dredging itself can cause physical injury or death to marine life through collisions, noise production, and increased cloudiness of the water (2).","(2) Victoria Todd et al., ""A Review of Impacts of Marine Dredging Activities on Marine Mammals.""

rope1,images/rope1.png,"While large whale populations are growing in the United States, entanglements pose a significant threat to the continued welfare of these species. Vertical buoy rope lines connect lobster traps that sit on the ocean floor to a buoy that floats on the surface. Whales swimming or feeding near traps can become entangled in this rope (1). According to estimates from NOAA fisheries and their partners, more than 85 percent of the North Atlantic right whale population display indications of entanglement in fishing gear.","(1) ""North Atlantic Right Whales and the Dangers of Vessel Strikes and Entanglement.""

rope2,images/rope2.png,"Fishing gear can cut into a whale's body, which can result in serious injuries, infections, or death. While whales can shed the gear, or the rope can be removed through disentanglement efforts, entanglement can compromise the animal's strength, impair its ability to feed or reproduce, and deplete the animal's energy required for these vital activities. Scientists believe that chronic rope entanglements are one reason why female right whales are having fewer calves (2).","(2) Joshua Reed et al.

rope3,images/rope3.png,"To safeguard whale populations against entanglement, the Northeast Fisheries Science Center and its partners are exploring options for modifying lobster traps to be ropeless (3). If you encounter an animal that is entangled or in distress, report it immediately. While maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards, stand by the animal until you've reported it. Stay in your vessel, call your region's entanglement specialists, note the GPS coordinate of the animal, monitor the situation, and wait for trained personnel to free the animal.

right-whale1,images/right-whale1.png,"North Atlantic right whales are social and typically live in pods, or small groups. Pods can range from a few whales to more than a dozen. Right whales often socialize at the ocean's surface; known for their agility, right whales often tail-slap and flipper-wave. Cubs usually spend at least an entire migration season with their mothers, traveling from Nova Scotia as far as the Gulf of Mexico together (1).","(1) ""North Atlantic right whales.""

right-whale2,images/right-whale2.png,"Right whales got their name from being the ""right"" whales to hunt, according to commercial whalers, because they floated when they were killed. They were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early 1890s. While whaling is no longer a threat, human interactions - such as fishing gear entanglement and vessel strikes - are the leading threats to still-endangered North Atlantic right whales. Only approximately 360 individuals remain, including less than 70 reproductively active females (2).","(2) ""North Atlantic Right Whale.""

On an individual level, this looks like cleaning beaches, supporting sustainable fisheries, donating to conservation projects, reporting entanglement sightings, alert and speed-conscious boating, and signing petitions for marine regulatory action. On a broader scale, this means fighting for climate justice: for example, vessel strikes are more likely as warming ocean temperatures lead right whales' food source closer to the ocean surface (3). Right whales are not safe until the Earth is.","(3) Jane Marsh, ""North Atlantic Right Whale Conservation Solutions.""

shipping2,images/shipping2.png,Researchers Rosalind M.

The researchers found a decrease in baseline concentrations of fGCs when there was an overall noise level decrease caused by fewer vessels traveling. The study also found that right whales respond to areas with high anthropogenic noises by amplifying their calls and increasing their frequency (2).,"(2) Rosalind M. Rolland et al.
