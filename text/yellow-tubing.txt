Shock tubing, a yellow plastic tubing resembling thin rope, is used to activate a detonation signal to underwater explosives. Shock tubing was used in a Boston Harbor dredging project that operated from June 2021 to January 2022. The yellow plastic tubing resembles thin rope, and it has been found in lengths ranging from 1 millimeter to 90 feet on beaches throughout Massachusetts and Rhode Island. (1)
The origin of the shock tubing remained uncertain until Laura Ludwig, the Manager of the Center for Coastal Studies' Marine Debris and Plastic Program in Provincetown, MA, established a link between the dredging project and the shock tubing washing ashore.  According to the Army Corps press release, the shock tube consists of low-density polyethylene. The material is considered safe for humans to touch, but small pieces may present health problems for animals if ingested.
