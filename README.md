<h3>I. Description</h3>
_ghostgearh8ers_ is a student project developed in May 2024 following a collaboration between the Center for Coastal Studies, a group of Cornell students led by Prof. Annie Lewandowski, and local residents and artists to clean up lobstering "ghost gear" on the beaches of Cuttyhunk Island.

This site seeks to communicate what we learned through this experience-- particularly the threats posed to North American Right Whales by current commercial fishing practices, and what each of us can do to help.

<h3>II. Updates</h3>
Last updated on 04/20/2024 to refresh speed and code readability. Mobile breakpoint in development; currently only functional in full screen desktop.
